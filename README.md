This repository contains solutions to a selection of exercises on the subject of measure theory and the Lebesgue integral.

# Background

A few months ago, a colleague and I found during a conversation that we shared an interest in mathematics. However, we do not have the same background, nor the exact same interests: he has studied probability theory, statistics, and mathematical finance. I am more interested in logic, type theory, and topology. He suggested measure theory as a subject none of us had yet studied in itself, and that relates to some of our interests. He proposed to use Donald Cohn's "Measure Theory", 2nd edition, as the textbook for our study, and so we started reading it and doing exercises. Occasionally, we get stuck, or need a proof checked, and look then for help on stackexchange. Some of the solutions here

# Contents

The repository contains the LaTeX sources for the solutions, named after the section the exercises appear in, as well as the PDF produced from these sources. The LaTeX version used to compile the sources comes from the texlive and AMS packages available in the stable Debian distribution. For compilation, the latex-mf package available in the same distribution is used.

# Intent

I use this repository to track the exercises I worked on and keep a backup of the LaTeX sources on my hard drive. New content is only added as I do more exercises. It is unlikely that people besides the two of us will be interested in what's here; I am writing this file in case someone stumbles across this repository and wonders what it is about.
