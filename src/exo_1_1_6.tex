\begin{exercise}

  Find an infinite collection of subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ that contains $\mathbb{R}$, is closed
  under the formation of countable unions, and is closed under the formation of countable intersections,
  but is not a $\sigma$-algebra.

\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}

  Let $\mathscr{A} = \{ \mathbb{R} \} \cup \{ [ {-n}, n ], n \in \mathbb{N} \}$, with $\varnothing = [ {-0}, 0 ]$,
  and let $\{ A_n \}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a family of elements of $\mathscr{A}$.
  For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $k \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $A_n = [ {-k}, k ]$.
  Let $K$ be the set of all such integers $k$.

  ~\\
  If $K$ is bounded above, then it has a largest element $M$
  since $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered. Then for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $A_n \subset [ {-M}, M ]$,
  and there exists $m \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $A_m = [ {-M}, M ]$. From this we deduce that
  $\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \,A_k = [ {-M}, M ] \in \mathscr{A}$.
  Otherwise, let $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Since $K$ is not bounded above, there exists $M, m \in \mathbb{N}$
  such that $x \in A_m = [ {-M}, M ]$. From this we deduce that $\cup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \,A_n = \mathbb{R} \in \mathscr{A}$.

  ~\\
  Since $K$ is nonempty, it has a smallest element $P$ since $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered, and there is some
  $p \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $A_p = [ {-p}, p ]$. From this we deduce that $A_p = \cap_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \,A_n \in \mathscr{A}$.

  ~\\
  The set $\mathscr{A}$ is stable by countable union and countable intersection, and contains $\mathbb{R}$. However
  it is not stable by complementation: for example $[ {-1}, 1 ] \in \mathscr{A}$, but $[ {-1}, 1 ]^c = ( {-\infty}, 1 ) \cup ( 1, {+\infty} )$
  is not a closed interval with integer boundaries. Therefore $\mathscr{A}$ is not a $\sigma$-algebra.

\end{proof}
